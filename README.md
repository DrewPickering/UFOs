UFO_Challenge

Project Overview:
Build a HTML file to be displayed in a web browser to provide viewers/users with searchable data of UFO sightings.  Use provided UFO sightings data from a JavaScript array to create a filterable table organizing UFO data based on, 1. Date, 2. Country, 3, State, 4. City, and 5. Shape.  

Purpose:
  •	Learn and apply JavaScript syntax in an example use cases.   
  •	Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions. 
  •	Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions. 
  •	Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop). 
  •	Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.
  •	Use Bootstrap to beautify the HTML file when displayed in a web browser

Resources:

  Data Source: JavaScript array
	
  Software: JavaScript as primary programming language, Bootstrap, 

Improvement Opportunities:

The data used to create the webpage is old and limited, linking the webpage to a more dynamic and broader dataset would make the application more valuable.
